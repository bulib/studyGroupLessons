This is a lesson on [pandoc](http://pandoc.org) for the BU Open Science Study Group.

To follow along with all of the examples, you'll need [to install pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html), have a functioning LaTeX installation, and, for the slideshow examples, initialize the reveal.js git submodule:

```
git submodule init util/reveal.js/3.3.0
git submodule update
```

Windows users who need LaTeX should look into [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/), Mac users should look at [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/), and Linux users should try installing [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/). You may need to install some LaTeX packages which you can install on Unix platforms with `tlmgr`.
