**Figure 1**: a) Velocities in the horizontal plane recorded by the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. The dominant direction of variability corresponds to the along-channel velocities, and that direction is extracted using principal components (the red arrows). b) The true discharge obtained with a handheld flow meter plotted against the index discharge derived from the ADCP. The red line represents the linear model $Q_{MM} = 0.4997Q_{ADCP} -0.0552$ used to calibrate the index discharge to the true discharge. c) Stage and discharge time series. The red dashed line in the stage time series represents the elevation of the channel bank. The spring-neap tidal cycle over the course of the month results in nonstationarity in the discharge time series. d) An example stage-discharge relationship from a one-month ADCP record in Sweeney Creek, Rowley, MA. Note the bidirectionality and hysteresis in ebb and flood.

**Figure 2**: a) The hypsometric curve estimated in the Boon model. b) The impulse response estimated in the linear, time-invariant model. c) The first-order Volterra kernel is equivalent to a linear, time-invariant impulse response (top). The second-order kernel is a two-dimensional analogue of the impulse response. The distance along the x- and y-axes are the lags backwards in time for each of the directions of the impulse response. The color is the amplitude of the impulse response. d) The k-means model estimates $k$ impulse responses (left). Each impulse response is used to estimate from the correspondingly colored point in the stage time series (right)

**Figure 3**: The modeled discharge plotted against the observed discharge. The red line in each plot is the one-to-one line.

**Figure 4**: The residual time series for each of the four classes of models: a) Boon, c) Linear, time-invariant, e) Volterra series g) k-means. The power spectrum of the residual time series for each of the four models b) Boon, d) Linear time-invariant, f) Volterra series, b) k-means.

**Figure 5**: a) The unregularized impulse response for the linear, time-invariant model. b) The regularized impulse response

**Figure 6**: Mean absolute percent error for each of the four models as a function of stage.
