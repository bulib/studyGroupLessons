# Why

* Personal research
    - Combine code, prose, and charts
    - Interactivity
    - How did I do what I did for what purpose?
* Collaborative research
    - Help explain code within groups
    - Publish notebooks with journal articles for near 100% reproducibility

# Why

* Teaching
    - [Write books or guides in notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks#entire-books-or-other-large-collections-of-notebooks-on-a-topic)
    - Use [Reveal.js Jupyter Slideshow Extension (RISE)](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) to create slide shows
        * See [example from BU Professor Mark Crovella for CS132](https://github.com/mcrovella/CS132-Geometric-Algorithms)
* See Nature articles:
