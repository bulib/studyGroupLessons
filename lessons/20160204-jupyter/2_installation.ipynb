    "[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) by [Continuum Analytics](https://www.continuum.io/) is a free Python distribution that contains more than 300 of the best Python packages for data analysis and scientific research. Armed with [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda), the cross-platform and Python-agnostic binary package manager shipped with Anaconda, the Anaconda distribution makes it easy and quick to install Python packages without worrying about third party library requirements, compiling, or version incompatibilities.\n",

    "## Additional Topic: Jupyter notebooks on the GEO/SCC cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Running `jupyter notebook` from your local machine is fairly trivial. It is also trivial to run the notebook from the GEO/SCC cluster, but there are a few security considerations that make it somewhat harder to run the notebook responsibly from the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security\n",
    "\n",
    "The `jupyter notebook` works just like a web server in that anyone with the IP and port number can access it through the internet. What makes it different from normal web servers is that the `jupyter notebook` has tremendous power and does not limit code execution. A malicious user could, for instance, delete your entire project folder if they had access to your notebook session. Thus, it is important to secure and protect your notebook session using encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will not try to include all information relevant to securing the notebook in this tutorial because it is likely to rapidly become out of date and, thus, insecure. Instead, I will link to the official security documentation and be happy to help anyone follow along:\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how to generate a password for your notebooks and an SSL certificate to encrypt your communication, please follow the guide linked below:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/public_server.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Port forwarding\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you follow the security steps listed above, it is pretty easy to connect to a head node on the cluster running the `jupyter notebook` session by forwarding the port of the notebook server from the remote host to your local host using SSH. For instance,\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 -N ceholden@geo.bu.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Users familiar with accessing the GEO/SCC head nodes via [Remote Desktop VNC sessions](http://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/system-usage/getting-started/remote-desktop-vnc/) will be used to this procedure. For those unfamiliar, the `-L` option to the `ssh` command is \"forwarding\" port 8888 on the `geo.bu.edu` server to my local machine. When I access `localhost:8888` in my web browser, the `ssh` session is forwarding my request to my local machine for port 8888 to the `geo.bu.edu` server which is hosting my `jupyter notebook` session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Head node versus compute node\n",
    "\n",
    "As all users of the GEO/SCC cluster should know, the head nodes are only to be used for lightweight tasks. Intensive computing and data visualization using the `jupyter notebook` is not one of these tasks. Instead of runnign the notebook server on the head node, one should use the `qsub` or `qsh` system to run the notebook server on a compute node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ceholden@geo: > qsh -V -l h_rt=24:00:00 -N jupyter_nb\n",
    "...\n",

    "ceholden@scc-gb08: > jupyter notebook\n",
    "[I 11:35:11.149 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /usr3/graduate/ceholden\n",
    "[I 11:35:11.150 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels \n",
    "[I 11:35:11.150 NotebookApp] The IPython Notebook is running at: https://[all ip addresses on your system]:8888/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I cannot directly access the compute node I've been assigned, `scc-gb08`, from my local machine. I have to go through a machine that can access it -- the \"head nodes\" `scc1.bu.edu`, `scc2.bu.edu`, `geo.bu.edu`, or `scc4.bu.edu`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to `ssh` into the compute node from the head node to confirm the RSA signature of the compute node (e.g., confirm that the machine is who it says it is):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "The authenticity of host 'scc-* (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.\n",
    "RSA key fingerprint is `RSA KEY`.\n",
    "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes\n",
    "Warning: Permanently added 'scc-*' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This only needs to be done once per compute node. When we connect to the compute node in the next step we will node have a chance to manually accept the RSA key so it is important to do this first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, tunnel through the head node (`geo.bu.edu` in this example) and into the compute node (`scc-gb08.bu.edu` in this example) using two SSH commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "ssh -L 8890:localhost:8890 ceholden@geo.bu.edu ssh -L 8890:localhost:8888 -N ceholden@scc-gb08\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first SSH command is almost identical to the forwarding we would perform if we only needed to access the head node. However, instead of not doing anything by passing the `-N` option, we will instead do another `ssh` command into the compute node.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are forwarding port 8888 from the compute node to port 8890 on the head node. From there we are forwarding port 8890 from the head node to our local machine. This is commonly referred to as \"multiple hops\" or \"multi-hop\". Since port 8888 on the compute node is now port 8890 on our local machine, we can simply access `localhost:8890` on our local web browser.\n",
