Installation instructions
If you'd like to install pandoc on your own computer, follow the instructions at http://pandoc.org/installing.html
I'm going to be using version 1.17.1. If you don't have the same version, everything should still work basically, but some features of pandoc might have changed between the versions (check http://pandoc.org/releases.html for details)

To output pdfs from pandoc, you'll need a LaTeX installation. This can be tricky to get right, so shoot me an email (wkearn@bu.edu) if you're having trouble.
	* Windows users: MikTeX (http://miktex.org/ ) is the recommended LaTeX distribution
	* Mac users: MacTeX (https://tug.org/mactex/ ) works but downloads a lot of packages (so it takes a while). You could try downloading BasicTeX (https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html), but you'll probably have to install some additional packages for pandoc's PDF output to work out properly. If you use Homebrew, note that Homebrew doesn't like to install TeX because of how complicated it gets.
	* Linux users: TeX Live (http://www.tug.org/texlive/ ) can usually be found in your package manager.
