Notes

Chris's presentation: https://bulib.github.io/studyGroupLessons/lessons/lightning-talks/restful-curl/

Restaurant analogy: Chefs have food, but you don't necessarily want them to interact with the customers too much because they're grumpy. So you put a wait staff to do the interaction. An API gets data from the server, which has a lot of stuff going on that you might not want to see, and gives it to the customers.
