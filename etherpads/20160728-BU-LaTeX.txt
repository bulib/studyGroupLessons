    LaTeX "big idea" separate writing from layout and design. LaTex uses a set of tags to help specify the styles you want 
    + everything can be written in text files 
    + meaning you can you use version control 

	*     First line will be class - journals will (sometimes) provide classes for their specific format
		* Example for a journal: Elsevier provides "elsarticle" documentclass for their journals
	*     "%" is the comment character
	*     Commands start with "\"
	* Packages allow you to use different environments, e.g. input encoding package that allows you to use unicode
		* When you install LaTeX, you get a subset of packages, may need to install others yourself
		* You can find packages at: https://www.ctan.org/?lang=en
	* LARGE SET of header statements in an average LaTeX file
	* 

Packages Covered 
inputenc 
graphicx - adds images 


Commands 
\title - add a title to your document 
\author - add the author to your document 
\date - add the date 
\maketitle - creates a title block, that starts a new page, it will take the content from \title , \author , \date 
\section - creates a new section, counting starts at 1 (but this can be configured) 
\section*{ text } - the * will remove counting from the output 
\subsection - creates a new subsection 
\LaTeX - prints out the good looking LaTeX logo with cool typesetting 
\includegraphics - add image to your file 
\figure - creates figure environment http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/2275/keeping-tables-figures-close-to-where-they-are-mentioned
\caption 
\begin{equation} 
\begin{figure}
\ref 

Errors 
Undefined control sequence - you might need to add the right package 


To cover afterwards 
+ how to add separate files  
+ figures 
+ File organization 
+ tables
